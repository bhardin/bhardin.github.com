Let's face it. Desktop backgrounds - or desktop wallpapers - are super cool. Having an awesome desktop background will make you the envy of your friends and coworkers. Nothing says how hard you are like a background of a cute kitty. If you don't have a unique desktop background you aren't a real computer user. 

Desktop backgrounds show others who you are, without saying anything. Having a single color background demonstrates your minimalism. A background with a Winston Churchill quote may [explain to others why you care about their attitude][8]. Using the standard background that comes with your computer tells others you don't know how to operate a computer.

Every time I see the standard image as a background, I die a little inside. I won't explain how to change your background, because if you don't know how to [Google it][7], you should return your computer from where you got it.

Malware sites in the past used desktop background sites for distributing malware. Potential victims would search Google for _cool desktop backgrounds_ and the results would have sites that contained malware. We may see a rise in desktop background sites distributing malware because of high resolution backgrounds and retina displays.

Even virus authors think unique desktop backgrounds are cool. The [Ikee worm][4] would change an iPhone's background to a picture of Rick Astley with the phrase, "ikee is never going to give you up." Hopefully malware writers will use high resolution images, so they look amazing on a retina display.

Kaspersky, an antivirus company, didn't want virus authors to have all the fun, so, they [released some backgrounds][virus calendar] with fun virus facts.

Hopefully Kaspersky doesn't require their employees to use these backgrounds. Enforcing a corporate background is lame. I agree with Herbert Kornfeld, [Ted Wegerle telling you to use the standard office-wide desktop background is wack][2].

I don't know if desktop wallpapers can [blow up your computer][6]. But, I love cool desktop wallpapers and this post is an excuse to tell you about my [github repository of cool desktop wallpapers][3]. I'd love to get pull requests of any awesome backgrounds you've created. Share it with me. If it's cool enough I'll use it as my desktop background.
