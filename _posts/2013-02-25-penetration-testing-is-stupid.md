meta_description: Organizations think they need penetration tests before they actually do.
---

The security community has been convinced they need penetration tests before they actually do. If your organization doesn't have a security person on staff, you don't need a penetration test. If you know their is low-hanging fruit that hasn't been fixed you don't need a penetration test.

In theory, penetration tests are supposed to simulate real word attacks. But, the scope and rules of engagement mean the test isn't simulating real world attacks.

The presentation focuses on the 5 W's - who, what, when, where, and why of penetration tests.
