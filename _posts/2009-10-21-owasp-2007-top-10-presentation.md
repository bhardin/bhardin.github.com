I recently did a presentation on the OWASP Top 10 for SecurityStreams. Nitesh Dhanjani of SecurityStreams was nice enough to allow me to embed the videos of the presentations on this site.

If you are new to the [OWASP Top 10](/2009/07/owasp-top-10-2007/), I highly suggest to watch this presentation, it is about 45 minutes and should give you a high level understanding of all the OWASP Top 10.

If you are an executive or don't have time to watch the full presentation, then I suggest watching the 10 minute executive presentation.

Make sure to watch them in HD (Upper right hand corner of the videos). Let me know your thoughts and comments.
