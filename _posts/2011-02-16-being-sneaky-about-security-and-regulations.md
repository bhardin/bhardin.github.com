[Mike Dahn](http://chaordicmind.com/blog/) and I believe that you can't create a corporate security policy based on regulations or compliance. In creating a security process that is attempting to pass compliance standards companies will fail at security. Instead, companies can focus on actual security process and as a byproduct pass compliance and regulatory audits.
