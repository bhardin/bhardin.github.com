I recently decided that I wanted to move my blog from [misc-security.com](http://misc-security.com) to a more general purpose blog. One reason is that I have had a shift from security into entrepreneurship, which is a hard word to spell, and startups.

I also wanted a place to jot down general thoughts. I don't have a central place to do this now, and I thought this would be a good place.

I was inspired by [Leo](http://leostartsup.com/) during [Angelpad][], when he said, _Just write and post._

So, that's what I'm going to do.
