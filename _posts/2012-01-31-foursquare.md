I am an avid FourSquare user. Rather strange, considering that I also enjoy my privacy.

I have convinced others to use FourSquare more often, including my [wife](http://twitter.com/bbtrainer) and my co-founder. Both were hesitant to use it at first, but, after I explained how I used it they came on board.

Since I have convinced others to use FourSquare, I figured it would be a good topic to blog about.

## Check Ins

Checking in to locations is completely opt-in. The whole argument of FourSquare or strangers knowing where you are at all times is false. The only people that ever see your "check-ins" are people who you want to know about your checkins.

The only other people that will see your check-ins are people at the same location of the place you check in. But that is one of the neat aspects of FourSquare is that you can meet other people at a venue you frequent.

## Letting Others Know

I mainly use foursquare as a group text message service. Instead of sending my wife a text when I arrive at work, I check-in. If I am going to meet my co-founder at Coffee, I just check in when I get there, instead of sending him a text saying, "I'm here." It just makes life simpler.

## Path vs. FourSquare

I recently got my wife to start using [path](http://path.com) in addition to her normal use of FourSquare. After a while, I stopped using path because I think foursquare has better execution. When I asked my wife which she liked better she stated:

> I'm still deciding. I'm not ready to give up my mayorships yet.

I find this hilarious because mayorships don't mean anything. FourSquare has really rocked her world when it comes to the gamification part of using it. I don't think I am swayed by gamification, however, I can't really explain why I like FourSquare better than path, so maybe I am.

Note: gamification is not in my default dictionary, but ramification is. Hm.
