A common question to ask when interviewing is, "On a scale of one through ten how would you rate yourself at this?" The interviewer assumes the candidate's responds is an accurate evaluation of their skill set. If the interviewer assumes the number given is accurate then they are not aware the interviewee's response suffers from the Dunning-Kruger Effect.

The Dunning-Kruger Effect is a cognitive bias where the unskilled rate their ability higher than the average while competent people undervalue their ability. Psychologists never studied the phenomena until David Dunning and Justin Kruger published their research, _[Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments][1]_ in 1999.

The reason unskilled people suffer from the Dunning-Kruger effect is that their own incompetence makes them unable to rate themselves fairly. They are evaluating themselves with a skill they don't properly understand. Their lack of understanding creates a situation where they are incapable of doing a proper self evaluation and recognize that they are unskilled.

But, the situation becomes puzzling once the unskilled person becomes knowledgable. Once they acquire the knowledge they need to do a proper self assessment they recognize the limitations of their abilities. Their better understanding of a subject makes them undervalue their own ability. They assume everyone is working from the same knowledge base they are. The more you learn, the more you understand you don't know much.

While interviewing someone if you ask _How would you rate yourself question_, the people who rate themselves high know less about the subject than a person who rates themselves at lower level.

This doesn't just happen with knowledge based skills either. Dunning and Kruger noticed it happened with humor, grammar, and logic.

> Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd.

I propose we stop asking candidates to rate their own abilities. However, If you decide to continue asking this question, keep the Dunning-Kruger effect in mind. The candidate's response will misrepresent the candidates skill set and ability.
