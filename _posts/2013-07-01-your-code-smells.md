Your code stinks.

If you don't refactor code, you are a worthless programmer. Reducing the smell of your code helps your own sanity as well as those around you.

If you don't refactor code your technical debt continues to increase. Programs you work with will be harder to maintain. 

80% of programming is maintenance.

Programming is refactoring. If you are working on anything of substance, it can benefit from refactoring.

In startups, speed is preferred over anything else. Once the prototype is written, code can be forgotten because, "Hey, It works." 

[Don't let this code continue to smell without being refactored.](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch10_Manage_Debt.php).

> Hack together some bad code that's functional but still a bit hairy and you're building up debt. Throw together a design that's good enough but not really good and you've done it again.

> __It's ok to do this from time to time__. In fact, it's often a needed technique that helps you do the whole Get-Real-ASAP thing. But __you still need to recognize it as debt and pay it off at some point__ by cleaning up the hairy code or redesigning that so-so page.
