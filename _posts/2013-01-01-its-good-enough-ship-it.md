Being done always trumps perfection. All humans, to some extent, are perfectionists. Our ideas, projects, and productions are fragile. We doubt ourselves and don't want to be embarrassed by something we've put our name on. We think people we respect will laugh at us if our work isn't any good.

[Linds Redding][3]:
> Most artists and designers I know would rather work all night than turn in a sub-standard job. 

I don't think this is limited to creatives. As humans, the hesitation to _release work_ is normal, but unfounded. Being uncomfortable gives us an excuse to procrastinate.

A few examples where we hesitate from potential embarrassment:

* Presenting at a respected conference in front of our peers.
* Building a software prototype, because one more feature needs to be developed, for it to be _finished_.
* Contributing to an open source project.
* Having to make something _prettier._
* Publishing a blog post.

In early-stage startups, founders think features are required before a product should be released. I challenge you to stop thinking this way. __Release early and release often.__ The feature you are waiting on won't get you more customers. Trust me. Release it now, get feedback, and then push another feature. Keep the iterations fast.

A friend said to me he'd been working on a blog post for two weeks. He explained he wanted more feedback on the post before he published it. I told him he should treat [his blog and his posts as small startups][1]. He should _launch_ blog posts early and often. With each post, he can get readers feedback and use it for the next post. I advised him to post it and told him not to worry about perfection. You will make mistakes and it's okay. Everyone stumbles. Just post it.

Seth Godin said that finding the perfect answer, isn't about initially knowing it. It's about the [journey towards it][2]. We may never find the perfect answer, but during the journey our answer  improves and becomes stronger.

Stop waiting for perfection. The current iteration is good-enough. Release it. Get important feedback and then work on the next thing. It doesn't matter if it's a feature for a product, a blog post, or a presentation. It can always be improved, nothing is ever perfect. If it was, it wouldn't need us.

It's good enough. Ship it.
