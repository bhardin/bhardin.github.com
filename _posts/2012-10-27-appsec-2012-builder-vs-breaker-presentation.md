meta_description: Builder versus Breaker Presentation from AppSec 2012.
---

Builders and Breakers don't understand one another. Rather than finding a way to communicate with each other, they take the easier path by insulating each other. The developers (builders) and security folk (breakers) need to start communicating and respecting one another. To demonstrate the miscommunication we decided to have a debate between the breaker and builder.
