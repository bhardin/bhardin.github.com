If you post content on the Internet but don't have comments enabled you don't have a blog. If you're writing valuable content and sharing your ideas, why wouldn't you want feedback? You should be looking to build your own community around your blog. It should be a place where people come to communicate and discuss subjects around your thoughts and ideas.

I agree with [Jeff Atwood][2] says about not having comments enabled. Even though it's for _comedic effect_.

> It's more like a church pulpit. You preach the word, and the audience passively receives your evangelical message. Straight from God's lips to their ears. When the sermon is over, the audience shuffles out of the church, inspired for another week. And there's definitely no question and answer period afterward.

Using the Internet to rant is a pretty common use case. Many blogs and communities are already established that are focused on ranting. But, If you stand on a soapbox and shout, nothing will change. To enable change you need to [start a conversation][3]. Enabling comments is the easiest way to begin the conversation.

## Default Blogs and Layouts

Tumblr annoys me. Although I love the idea of giving users awesome designs and layouts, [Tumblr doesn't enable comments by default][4]. It infuriates me. Any time I see _USER55 posted this from THISAWESOMESITE_ I get frustrated. 

[This Guy][1] talks about leaving his wife during pregnancy to study programming in order to provide a better future for his son. It's an awesome post and has great story telling. But, I want to leave a comment. I want to tell him good luck in his endeavors as a father. I want to explain how fatherhood is a true entrepreneurial endeavor. But, I can't. There is no place for my voice. Unless I use another community to do so and hope he somehow reads it.

I like what [Dustin Curtis][5] has done with Svbtle. Svbtle has beautiful default layouts and many great authors. However, I can't comment on any of their posts. At most, I can give them Kudos. It drives me crazy!

## Leveraging Other Communities

Leveraging another community for your comments is an interesting idea. Sites like HackerNews and Reddit have already built communities around topics you may write on. [Tom Preston-Werner][6] uses HackerNews for comments on his blog. At the bottom of each post he tells his readers they can , _Discuss this post on Hacker News_. 

Leveraging other communities for comments is interesting, however, you are missing out on people that don't know those communities exist. These sites are discussion boards for a community which have already been established around a core set of ideas. They think the same.

By enabling comments on your blog you are creating your own community. One that is reserved for you. If someone wants to say something directly to you they can. With third-party sites if someone wants to write something to the author, the author may or may not see it. On HackerNews, I've seen responses that say things like, "The author should do this." These are the types of comments that should be on their blog. In posting to a third-party site, there is no guarantee the author will ever see their comment.

The comments on your blog should be on your blog, not another site. The information should be kept together.

## Use Disqus For Comments

My favorite thing to see on sites is Disqus. I am more likely to post a comment because I know there is an easy way for me to do it. I don't need to create credentials for a website or type a bunch of information before I can comment.

If you host your own comments, through a WordPress instance, I probably won't comment. I don't want to create credentials for your website. I don't want to enter a bunch of information for a site I may only partake in once.Although these methods have been created to deter spam, they increase my barrier to entry for commenting on your thoughts. Disqus has established an identity around the person commenting that travels with them from site to site. This is a better way of decreasing spam and decreasing the barrier to entry for comment.

With Disqus, I can post a comment on someone's site and continue on reading other's content. If I decide to comment on a new post, I'm already [logged in][7] and ready to comment. If the author from the first site responds to my comment I can see it on the new blog I'm on. They've created a central place to manage my responses across all the communities I participate in.

When I first started seeing Disqus on blogs, I was pessimistic. I couldn't see the value, from an [SEO perspective][8], of hosting your comments through a third-party. However, using Disqus has changed my mind on the value of their service.

The Internet allows us to write content and share it with others. Books have been published for thousands of years using this method. An author writes content, gets the content published, and distributes it to an audience. However, the Internet gives us a better medium than books. Rather than using the traditional method to write and publish, we can enable conversation. We can communicate our ideas and thoughts and allow the world, or anyone with an Internet connection, to weigh in on them. This a much better approach in sharing our ideas. So turn on comments and begin a conversation.
