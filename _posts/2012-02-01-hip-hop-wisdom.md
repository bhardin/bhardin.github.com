It's hard to listen to hip hop without hearing it's entrepreneurial spirit. More than any other musical type, hip-hop is all about marketing and business.

The most successful artists are excellent at self-promotion, diversification, and image. 

It makes sense taking into account many hip hop successes have previously sold some type of drug, which is a business. Eazy-E put together enough drug money to create NWA. Most of us are thankful he did. [Tweet This](http://clicktotweet.com/Kxi61)

## Sean Combs
Diddy has to be the master "brander." Anyone who can change there own brand three times is pretty amazing. First was Sean Combs, then "Puff Daddy," into "P. Diddy," into just "Diddy".

He also has a massive empire including:
* A restaurant chain called Justin's 
* Two clothing brands, Sean John and Enyce.
* Ciroc Vodka

## Jay-Z
The master of diversification. Jay-Z leads the way by having most hip-hop artists follow in his footsteps. Jay-Z starts a clothing line, other hip-hop artists start a clothing line.

His Empire Includes:
* Music Company, Roc Nation, a 10-year profit sharing venture with Live Nation
* Rocawear - Clothing Line.
* Carol's Daughter - A beauty line.
* New Jersey Nets
* Sports Bar Chain (40/40 Club)
* The Spotted Pig (Restaurant)

## 50 Cent and Energy Brands
Curtis Jackson, a.k.a 50 Cent made a fortune when Energy Brands (Glaceau) was sold to Coca-cola. When the CEO of Energy Brands, J. Darius Bikoff, discovered that 50 Cent was a fan of Vitamin Water, Bikoff made the most of the opportunity. 50 Cent received 10% of the company for being a spokesman for Vitamin Water in October of 2004.

## Paul Wall
Paul Wall is an excellent marketer. He built a huge following in Houston, Texas. Once he was discovered on a national level, the first thing he does is start promoting his own [brand of grillz](http://www.grillsbypaulwall.com/).

## Venture Capital
**Ben Horowitz** - If you didn't know, Ben is a _huge_ fan of rap and hip hop music. Every post I have read on [Mr. Horowitz blog](http://bhorowitz.com/) has a rap quote to introduce the article.
