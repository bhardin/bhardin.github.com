meta_description: The value and benefits of joining AngelPad - A San Francisco Business Incubator.
---

Many people have asked about my experience at AngelPad. After exchanging emails with many people, I figured more people could benefit if I made the knowledge public. Outside the standard things you hear about social proof and connections to angels and venture capital. These are things which I think were helpful while going through the program and I still benefit from today.

## Network Value
I can not stress how important this is. The value of the network was the most important thing to us going into Angelpad. In our interview, Thomas asked us, "Why do you want in Angelpad?"

We stated, the network was the most important thing to us. We explained we wanted to exploit and leverage his network in order to optimize our success.

Once accepted to Angelpad, the value of the network was immediately apparent. Thomas accelerated our connections in the valley. Networks can be valued using Metcalfe's law: The value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of people in the network. With Angelpad however, the value of the network _is_ more likely cubed.

Since the AngelPad network is composed of Google Mafia, they are incredibly well connected. It is relatively easy to get a meeting in the valley with anyone you want if you have a compelling reason why you should meet them. The Angelpad network is well connected.

## Advisors Availability

While we were going through AngelPad, we had some great advisors and speakers including [Hiten Shah](http://hitenism.com/), [Neil Patel](https://twitter.com/neilpatel/), [Elad Gil](http://blog.eladgil.com/), [Jeff Clavier](http://softtechvc.com/team_member/jeff-clavier/), [Keval Desai][Keval], [Dave McClure](http://500hats.com/), and [Gokul "The Man" Rajaram](https://www.facebook.com/gokul.rajaram).

Each of these advisor talked to us for about an hour and then had one-on-one's with us for 8 minutes, where we could ask them anything we wanted. The 8-minutes was setup specifically to make us get right to the point of what we wanted to know. A skill every founder should practice and utilize.

Thomas Korte, who runs Angelpad, bends over backwards to make himself available to you. You are required to meet him once a week. But, you can talk with him as much as you would like because he works out of the office every day. This alone makes AngelPad worth it. Having a successful angel investor working closely with you for 10-weeks is an invaluable learning experience.

The advisors also make themselves available after AngelPad. We still regularly reach out to them to ask questions and seek advice. 

## Working Together
A unique thing about AngelPad is that you are required to go to the office each day. This is incredibly different in comparison to YC, where you only meet once a week. This was incredibly useful for Matt and I. We were surrounded by amazing entrepreneurs who constantly gave us great feedback and insight.

You are also creating tight life-long friendships. I still regularly call and email my fellow classmates for advice and they do the same. You learn from each other and help lean on them when you need help. They will help you, just as you are willing to help them.

## What You Put In Is What You Get
Angelpad is not for the weak or faint of heart. If you need hand holding, Angelpad is not for you. Angelpad is designed to challenge your assumptions about your business, market, product, and vision. __The experience will tear you down and rebuild you stronger.__ However, this will only happen if you give it everything you have. This requires a huge commitment on your part.

If you are looking for an incubator to help you with a lifestyle business, don't apply to AngelPad. [AngelPad](http://angelpad.org/) is looking for companies that are attempting to change the world. If you have that type of foresight, vision, or dream: I will see and talk with you soon.
