I read a lot of online content through my daily life. While consuming different media, I am constantly reminded that short content is easier to digest.

The next time you decide to write something _get to the point as fast as possible._

The idea of unnecessary words and abundant sentences must come from our adolescence. The [current education system][education] gives children assignments forcing them to focus on the amount of words they write. Teachers incentive students to fill the page with words rather than necessary content.

In Seth Godin's [startup school lectures][1] he states all non-fiction books can be written in 5 pages. The purpose of writing more is that as human beings we don't value the content unless their is an abundance of it. The value of a book is determined by it's weight.

Great authors demonstrate their command of language by writing succinctly. In the 1920's Ernest Hemingway wrote a short story using 6 words. 

> For Sale. Baby Shoes. Never Worn.

Although an [unverified][2] account, the passage demonstrates you can transfer an idea in very few words.

The Internet begs content generators to do this. The abbreviation _TL; DR_ (Too Long; Didn't Read) was created explicitly to summarize posts [deemed unnecessarily long and extensive][3].

The book, [On Writing Well][4], which explains to authors how to write non-fiction has multiple chapters on simplicity and removing clutter.

> But the secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that servers no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that's already in a the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what - these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentance. And they usually occur in proportion to eduction and rank.

Stop using words to fill pages with endless amounts of unneeded language.

The next time you write an email, a reference document, or a blog post, I don't care about your education. I care about the point you are trying to make.

## TL; DR

* Get to it.
* Make it easy to consume.
* Use simple language.
