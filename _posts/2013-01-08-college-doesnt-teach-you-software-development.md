meta_description: The tools and methods I use everyday when developing software I didn't learn at a university. I learned them on my own.
---

I've been involved with [technology and software since I was young][1]. So, when I was researching colleges to attend, I chose a university with a good computer science department. After graduating from college nearly 8 years ago, I realize how little I learned in college about developing good software. 

I'm not the strongest developer. I can get code working, but I'm still learning how to optimize it. I try to [suck less every year][2]. But, I think my university didn't prepare me for the real world. I paid a fortune for my college education, but, I use what I learned very little. The software principles I use daily, [I've learned on my own][6]. 

Of course, graduating from college does allow me to check off that box that says I have a college degree. I learned about Descartes and _Discourse on the Method_, [American concentration camps][3], and [a lot about wine][4]. But, the degree I obtained in Computer Science doesn't help me write good code. 

Although I know there is a difference between computer science and software development, __why didn't I learn more things which would help me become employed__? 

Isn't it the universities job to give you an education that helps you apply what you learn in the real world? _Franchise colleges_ like Devry, University of Phoenix, and ITT Tech, pride themselves on giving you an education that you can use. But, those colleges aren't as highly regarded as single-location 4-year institution. 

Here is a list of things I use every day when developing software that my single-location university didn't teach me: 

* __Revision Control Systems__ - Although the university emphasized working in groups, we never learned about version control systems. Using Git or SVN will teach you more about collaborating with others than working in a group will. 
* __Unit Tests__ - This is the one that probably pisses me off the most. Although I learned about advanced data structures and compiler design, I wasn't taught good coding practices. How are you expected to write good, reusable code if you don't know how to write tests to support it? I'm curious if the teachers wrote unit tests to test our projects. Although this would have made their jobs easier, I doubt they used tests. The words "testing suite" were never heard in the hallways. 
* __Closures__ - Never touched the concept of functions being able to accept functions. I learned about Lisp from a friend while hanging out between classes and [wrote some game with it][5]. But, aren't students supposed to get their _real_ education inside the classroom? 
* __Programming Paradigms__ - Looking this one up, it seems other universities, like Stanford, have [programming paradigms in the curriculum][7]. Not learning about paradigms is probably unforgivable. Although the other items in this list are about software development, programming paradigms are fundamental to computer science. Did I not learn about these because I went to a dreaded state school rather than a _real_ university? 
* __Big-O Notation__ - All great developers should identify the Big-O notation an algorithm. Understanding how to optimize code to scale is important. One professor discussed Big-O for 10 minutes, but, universities should emphase it more heavily. Employers love asking entry level developers to identify Big-O notation of algorithms in job interviews. 
* __Functional Programming__ - The university I attentended had a grant from Sun Microsystems, so I'll let you guess the language preferred around campus. Although I was a fundamentalist and decided to write everything in C++, we never learned about functional programming. Everything was object-oriented. 
* __Working in an IDE__ - In college I learned how to code everything in vi. Don't bother leaving a comment about emacs, I know it's superior. But, I never learned how to use an IDE. I now live in one when developing. Understanding how to setup Eclipse for a legacy code project would have been a useful addition to my college education. 
* __JavaScript__ - No front-end code. Ever. The closest project on writing front-end code was developing Java applets. What a crappy decision that was, whoever suggested students should learn about Java applets to fulfill an education requirements. 

Why didn't college teach me these things? 

Did anyone else have this lack of education at their university or am I an outlier? Sound off in the comments.
