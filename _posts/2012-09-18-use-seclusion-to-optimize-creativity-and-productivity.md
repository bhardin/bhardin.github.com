I recently read through this [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/pbohm/having-an-impact) and was intrigued by an idea presented:

> Being Persistent is often easier when faced with adversity and solitude. Many successful writers 
> chose not to talk about their work in progress. They determined that getting praise for 
> unfinished work doesn't lead to actual success and getting praise made them less likely to do a 
> good job.

The idea of using seclusion to optimize productivity is intriguing. Many authors lived in seclusion for long periods of time in order to write to the best of their ability. Recent research has shown some of the positive benefits of being alone. A paper released in 2003 found that children who couldn't bear to be alone aren't good at developing creative talents. Implying solitude aids in creativity.

## Great Authors vs. Great Products

There are some obvious benefits of being secluded. Living in isolation from the world means that your thoughts and choices aren't affected by those around you. The lack of interaction allows one to be immersed with their own thoughts. Solitude gives time for contemplation and self-examination.

There is no feedback loop. At the end of the authors writing they sent their manuscript to a publisher that reviews the text and gives them feedback. They then incorporate feedback and another revision is made. This continues until both the publisher and author are happy with the end result.

Building a product is similar. Once you create the initial prototype, you push it out for feedback. This is the "launch early" mantra that fits into lean principles. To the authors, the publisher, is the early adopter.

## Negative Feedback Loop
Your friends and family will always tell you that you are smart and your product (or writing) is awesome. The author, being secluded, is removing themselves from their own positive feedback loop.

Although it can be encouraging to hear from your close circle that you are building something great, it is the worst thing you can hear. If you have to ask your friends and family for feedback, start by telling them it is okay to give you negative feedback. Insist on it. Tell them to repress any positive feedback they have and only tell you things that need to be fixed. This is what good customers should do too.

Take the feedback and use it to improve the product even more. A negative feedback loop is what you are aspiring for.

## Repressing Depression
Although creativity is a major byproduct of solitude, so is depression. Being alone and hearing and thinking negative things can lead to depression. It is no coincidence that secluded authors suffer from depression. Being away from people, left to only your own thoughts, can be burdensome to say the least.

Emily Dickinson is a great example. She lived in seclusion most of her life and was depressed for most of it.

The trick is to only seclude yourself when you are creating. You need to come up for air and feedback once you are at a good stopping point. I disagree with most people thinking that they are going to build a beautiful first product before releasing. Don't let the mantra of Steve Jobs wannabes persuade you. Develop something good enough, and release it. Take feedback and iterate.
