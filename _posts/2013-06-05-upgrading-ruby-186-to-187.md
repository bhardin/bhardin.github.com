meta_description: Steps to check when upgrading from Ruby 1.8.6 to Ruby 1.8.7
---

Although this post is a little over due I thought it could potentially help other people attempting to do the update. I wanted a guide which could help people do the update and understand what needs to go into doing it.

## OSX Install

For some reason tcl-tk is borked with the Ruby 1.8.7. You can install 1.8.7 by doing the following.

    rvm install 1.8.7 --without-tcl --without-tk
    brew install tcl-tk
    rvm reinstall 1.8.7

## Searching Your Code Base

Ruby 1.8.7 mainly added additional methods to classes. This means that it is pretty much backwards compatible. There are a few exceptions [regarding incompatibility](http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/tags/v1_8_7/NEWS). These exceptions are documented here.

### String#slice!

`String#slice!` had some unintentional bugs and they have been fixed  because either they disagreed with documentation or their respective  behavior of `#slice`.  Unfortunately, this causes some  incompatibilities in the following (somewhat rare) cases. 

* \`#slice!` no longer expands the array when an out-of-boundary value is given.

__Ruby 1.8.6__

{% highlight ruby %}
a = [1,2]
a.slice!(4,0)   #=> nil
a               #=> [1,2,nil,nil]
{% endhighlight %}

__Ruby 1.8.7__

{% highlight ruby %}
a = [1,2]
a.slice!(4,0)   #=> nil
a               #=> [1,2]
{% endhighlight %}

* \`#slice!` no longer raises an exception but returns nil when a negative length or out-of-boundary negative position is given.

__Ruby 1.8.6__

{% highlight ruby %}
a = [1,2]
a.slice!(1,-1)  #=> (raises IndexError)
a.slice!(-5,1)  #=> (raises IndexError)
{% endhighlight %}

__Ruby 1.8.7__

{% highlight ruby %}
a = [1,2]
a.slice!(1,-1)  #=> nil
a.slice!(-5,1)  #=> nil
{% endhighlight %}

### String#to_i

The behavior in Ruby 1.8.6 was inconsistent with Ruby syntax and considered as  a bug. `String#to_i`, `String#hex` and `String#oct` no longer accept a sequence  of underscores (`__') as part of a number.

__Ruby 1.8.6__

{% highlight ruby %}
'1__0'.to_i     #=> 10
'1__0'.to_i(2)  #=> 2  # 0b10
'1__0'.oct      #=> 8  # 010
'1__0'.hex      #=> 16 # 0x10
{% endhighlight %}

__Ruby 1.8.7__

{% highlight ruby %}
'1__0'.to_i     #=> 1
'1__0'.to_i(2)  #=> 1
'1__0'.oct      #=> 1
'1__0'.hex      #=> 1
{% endhighlight %}

## Date.parse

'##.##.##' (where each '#' is a digit) is now taken as 'YY.MM.DD' instead of 'MM.DD.YY'. While the change may confuse you, you can use `.strptime` to replicate the old way it was done.

{% highlight ruby %}
Date.strptime("01.02.03", "%m.%d.%Y")
{% endhighlight %}

I could not actually replicate this functionality personally. Let me know if you have any success.

{% highlight ruby %}
1.8.7 :001 > a = Date.parse("01.02.03")
=> #<Date: 3442913/2,0,2299161>

1.8.6 :001 > a = Date.parse("01.02.03")
=> #<Date: 3444309/2,0,2299161>
{% endhighlight %}

Keep in mind, this [changed again in 1.9](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9483563/differences-in-date-string-parsing-between-ruby-1-9-3-and-ruby-1-8-7).

## StringIO#each_byte    

The return value changed from nil to self.  This is what the document says and the same as each_line() does.

## tempfile  

The file name format has changed. No dots are included by default in temporary file names any more. This shouldn't be a problem, unless you are permanently keeping temporary files. Which is the exact opposite of what temp files should be used for. Seems like a bad coding practice to me.

## URI
  Made changes to `FTP` and `URI.merge` to accommodate [RFC3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986). These are more bugs in 1.8.6 than anything else. But still search your code base to see if URI is used.

### FTP      

{% highlight ruby %}
URI('ftp://example.com/foo').path #=> 'foo'
URI('ftp://example.com/%2Ffoo').path #=> '/foo'
URI::FTP.build([nil, 'example.com', nil, '/foo', 'i').to_s #=> 'ftp://example.com/%2Ffoo;type=i'
{% endhighlight %}

### URI.merge

{% highlight ruby %}
URI('http://a/b/c/d;p?q').merge('?y') == URI('http://a/b/c/d;p?y')
URI('http://a/b/c/d;p?q').merge('/./g') == URI('http://a/g')
URI('http://a/b/c/d;p?q').merge('/../g') == URI('http://a/g')
URI('http://a/b/c/d;p?q').merge('../../../g') == URI('http://a/g')
URI('http://a/b/c/d;p?q').merge('../../../../g') == URI('http://a/g')
{% endhighlight %}
