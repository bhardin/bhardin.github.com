If you are a developer, I guarantee that you have written insecure code. Universities train people to write code, but very little time is taken to help them focus on writing **secure code**.

As with anything, being able to identify security vulnerabilities and writing code securely takes practice. But how does a developer, who is already overburdened with enough work, find the time or resources to help him identify security vulnerabilities?

This is where [spotthevuln.com](http://spotthevuln.com) comes in.

The purpose of the project is two fold, help developers write better code by enabling them to identify insecure code and hopefully work the project into teaching curriculum's at colleges and universities in order to help new developers write more secure code.

Here is how the site works. On Monday at 8:00am PST, a piece of vulnerable code is posted. An business week is given to people in order to attempt to identify the vulnerability in the code. On Friday at 8:00am PST, the code fix is shown with a description of what was wrong with the code. All of the vulnerabilities are taken out of open source projects in order to show developers "real-life" scenarios. The fixes are the fixes that were actually deployed.

The whole point of spotthevuln.com is to help developers identify poor development choices when programming. What are your thoughts? Do you think this will help developers? If you are an instructor and would like to work spotthevuln.com into your curriculum, I suggest for you to reach out to spotthevuln.com.

**The more developers know about security, the better off we all are.**
