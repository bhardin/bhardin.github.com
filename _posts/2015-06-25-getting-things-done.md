I have taken many [personality tests][personality types] in my life. I don't question their validity, but, when an employer asks me to take one, I become hesitant. It's a waste of time for an employer to give employees personality tests to better enable communication.

About a year ago, our [entire company][kissmetrics] took a [personality test][color test]. Before I stated personality tests are a waste of time to employers and employees. This time it wasn't.

Traditionally, a personality test reveals the general type of person you are. The results focus on:

* How you act given a certain situation. The traditional example is putting together a swing set.
* Communication methods for communicating with opposite types.
* Understanding more about yourself to work on weaknesses and emphasizing strengths.

Personality tests break people down into how they think about problems. [Analyticals][personality types] focus on the why of problems. [Expressives][personality types] are natural leaders with a tendency to be chatty. [Amiables][personality types] are thinkers and dreamers and are usually creative. [Drivers][personality types] are no-holds-barred and get to the point as fast as possible.

[This test][color test] was a bit different. It was refreshing. Rather than focusing on how to communicate, it emphasized these things:

* What you are.
* What you expect in others.
* How you find comfort. What rejuvenates you.

[Insights][Color test] used their own categorization system based on colors. The colors have a specific type associated with it. Insights also uses extra terms for personalities which aren't dominate. Those personalities which share two or more types. But, the base descriptions are enough for our discussion.

I have simplified the colors as follows:

* Blue: Creative.
* Green: Procedure.
* Red: Completion.
* Yellow: People.

## What I Am

The results of the test were surprising. While most personality tests read like a horoscope, these results were precise. I read the results to my wife and she laughed asking if they scanned my brain for the results.

It came as no surprise that I was in the *red*, getting things done, category. I inherited this trait, good or bad, from my mother. I value, above anything else, the ability of execution.

Although being *red* sounds awesome to Entrepreneurs and Business people there are drawbacks. One flaw I've felt many times.

When a *red* personality can't complete a task in a reasonable time they become frustrated and begin not caring about the task.

When I've worked at large companies, I've felt this. When management requires buy-in on the plan to complete tasks, I become frustrated. A simple task becomes like moving a mountain.

## What I Expect of Others

I also expect *red* from other people. Not only do I execute, but I expect others to execute also. This is one of reasons I'm not a huge fan of large corporate environments. These corporations provide places for lazy people to hide.

These corporations emphasize a place to come and hang-out for 8 hours and collect a pay check. Something I despise to my core.

People spend their work hours: in meetings, dealing with office politics, and following corporate structure.

I attempt to spend my office time accomplishing whatever goal the company has set. I expect others to have this same focus. When they don't, I become irritated.

## How I Find Comfort

Here is where the test enlightened me to the enigma of my personality type that no other test has ever shown me.

**I find comfort and am revitalized by getting things done.**

The 'for the management' section of results stated:

> When Brett accomplishes a task, reward him by giving him another task.

Hilarious! But so true. Once I complete something, I want to move on to another task. An amazing, although repetitive, cycle.

## Red Through and Through

I have always known that I'm like this, but my test results are interesting because of my feedback loop. I am red in what I am, what I expect, and how I get revitalized.

Let's review:

* Above all else, I want to complete done.
* Above all else, I expect others to complete things.
* I get satisfaction in completing things.

This means that I want to complete tasks. When I don't, I become frustrated. If things don't move, I will give up on the project. I stop caring because the task can't move forward. I have left companies for this exact reason.

## Not Accomplishing Tasks

When my wife and I first got married I would wake up early on Saturday morning. While my wife continued to sleep, I would begin cleaning the house. When my wife woke up, usually an hour later, I would cleaning like a madman.

My wife would make a cup of coffee, see how fast I was moving, and become frustrated because I was _too_ motivated to clean the house.

After taking the color test I understood the reason I would clean the house on some weekends and not on others. I was cleaning the house because I wasn't getting tasks accomplished at the office. Corporate politics would prevent me from getting things done and to compensate I wanted to complete something at home. For me, this was cleaning the house. It was something I could complete in a reasonable time.

The flip side is once I found an employer aligned with my way of thinking, I no longer woke up early to clean the house. Instead, I would stay in bed with my wife.
