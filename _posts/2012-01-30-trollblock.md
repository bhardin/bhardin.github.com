I just came back from startup weekend san jose. The event was amazing. This is my second startup weekend that I attended.

This time around we built [trollblock](http://trollblock.com). Trollblock was originally entitled cowblocker, but we decided that the purpose of the site, was more inline with blocking trolls.

Trollblock's entire concept originated from Finbarr Taylor, an amazing developer currently at Groupon.

Trollblock's original idea was, *An anti-social network*. By default, when you joined everyone on the site is your friend. After interacting with people you decide who you want to _block_ and _dislike_.

We had a working site withing 24 hours using node.js, reddis, mongodb, bootstrap, and knockback.

Upon launching, we posted to hackernews and were soon upvoted to 3rd on the frontpage.

We had over 330 signups in the first hour and 150 of those users stayed on for over an hour.

Talk about great _stickyness_.

We didn't win, but I personally learned a lot about bootstrap and knockback.
