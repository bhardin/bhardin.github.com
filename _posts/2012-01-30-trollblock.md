I just came back from Startup Weekend San Jose. This is my second startup weekend that I attended and just like last time the event was amazing.

This time around my team built [trollblock](http://trollblock.com). Trollblock was originally entitled cowblocker, but we decided that the purpose of the site, was more inline with blocking trolls.

### Concept
Trollblock's original idea was **An anti-social network**. 

Upon logging into Trollblock everyone is your friend. After interacting with people that are also on the site you decide who you want to *block* and *dislike*.

Trollblock's entire concept originated from [Finbarr Taylor](http://finbarrtaylor.com/), an amazing developer currently at Groupon.

We had a working site within 24 hours using node.js, reddis, mongodb, bootstrap, and knockback.

### Launching
Upon launching, we posted to hackernews and were soon had the 3rd spot on the front page.

We had over 330 signups in the first hour and 150 of those users stayed on for over an hour! Talk about great **stickyness**.

We didn't win, but I personally learned a lot about bootstrap and knockback.

If you haven't ever gone to a [startup weekend](http://startupweekend.com) event, I highly recommend it. There are events all over the world. You will learn something new and meet great people. You don't have any excuses.
