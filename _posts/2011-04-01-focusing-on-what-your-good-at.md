When I was in high school I was focused on being good at everything. Some time passed and I realized that successful people focus on one (1) aspect of their life and dive deep. Really Deep.

While approving my blog comments, I came a comment of someone trying to XSS the comments.

I chuckled and thought, "Why would someone care about Cross-Site Scripting my site?"

## Targeting my site

Was someone trying to "hack" me to prove a point?

There are much more powerful and well respected bloggers than me in the information security realm. Why target me? If you want to gain visibility for your attack go after someone like Jeremiah Grossman, Billy Rios, Chris Evans, or Rafal Los. If you XSS their star on the walk of fame, you will generate some buzz. But it won't last long. People's memories are short.

## Practice Before You Execute

When doing a presentation I prepare. I never was a boy scout, but being prepared is a way to feel confidant in what you do. I don't like to "wing it."

I prefer to start my presentation months ahead of time and keep focusing and refocusing it. Making the presentation tighter and tighter, until it is the best that I can do. Why do I prepare this much for a presentation maybe 10 people will see? To avoid embarrassment.

Presenting on something that you are unprepared for is the most excruitating thing I can imagine. It is my worst nightmare.

The person posting this comment did just that. They attempted to execute before they prepared.

## Do Your Homework

I would like to give advice to the fledgling hacker. If you want to find XSS on a site, start by doing reconnaissance. Before typing in blindly to fields alert(123) do some research.

This site is clearly using Wordpress. Download Wordpress, install it, and Identify XSS attacks that you could launch on my site. Can't find any? No problem. Start looking at the source code for XSS. Trust me, they exist.

## Notes on The Attack

Comments need to be approved. So, even if this XSS was valid I would personally have to share it with my readers. In doing your homework, realize that other bugs, such as remote code execution, are WAY better. Look for those.

## Return to Focusing

The next time you put things in perspective ask yourself, "Am I focusing on something I care about?" If the answer is yes, continue down the righteous path. If the answer is no, find your purpose.
