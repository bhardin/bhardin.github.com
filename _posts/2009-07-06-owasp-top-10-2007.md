When developing a security strategy for web applications many companies have no idea where to begin. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) understood this problem and developed the OWASP Top 10.

The OWASP top 10 are the top 10 vulnerabilities that are found in web applications. If you have an hour or don't want to read all of these posts, you can simply watch a video.

If you are a developer, you should understand these vulnerabilities. Understanding them is critical into introducing less vulnerabilities into your code.

The OWASP Top 10:
A1 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
A2 - Injection Flaws
A3 - Malicious File Execution
