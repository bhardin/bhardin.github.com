I spoke at BsidesSF 2011 by submitting the following Abstract.

> Implementing any type of policy or procedure is a challenging. Security Policies and Procedures are even more challenging. This talk will not include roadmaps, diagrams, or bulky slides. This talk will be filled with humorous stories and anecdotes about how I begin attempting to be a fixer instead of a breaker. This talk may or may not involve drinking beer. Please dress accordingly.

I lost the slides, however, Dennis Fisher watched the presentation and did I nice writeup at [threatpost][1].

## Slides
Lost Forever. Somehow I misplaced them. If I ever find them I will upload them. However, I have promised myself to never let this happen again.

## Video
This event was taped but I have not been told where the video's are hosted. If anyone knows, let me know.
