meta_description: Your startups growth hypothesis and value hypothesis are critical to it's success.
---

As someone who has been involved with startups for a few years, I often hear the same phrases get thrown around. Ideas like Lean Startup, Customer Development, Minimum Viable Product, or [Does your product solve a hard problem](/2012/02/solving-hard-problems/), are often cited. After going back the texts that introduced these concepts and reading them, I am highly skeptical that everyone has actually read these books.

A phrase that I don't hear is Value and Growth Hypothesis. These are two critical concepts that every startup should know about. The concepts are described and discussed in Ries' text, [The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887898/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=breharsblo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307887898). I hear people talk about a minimum viable product, another concept mentioned in the book, but not value and growth hypotheses.

Value and growth are the only two things you are constantly focused on at a startup. Even if the startup is highly profitable you are still identifying other value you provide or even faster ways to grow. Value and growth are phrases you hear, but not positioned as a hypothesis.

## Value Hypothesis
There is a reason that I am starting with a value rather than growth. The value you provide is the only reason that someone is going to use your product or service. __The value hypothesis tests if your product actually is valuable to your customers.__

This hypothesis will determine if the product or service should be used and adopted into your customers lives. Once you identify a reason your product is valuable, test it. Do the results of your test live up to your assumptions? Do not pull the wool over your own eyes. If the results of your experiment don't live up to your expectations, come up with a new value hypothesis and test.

It is important to understand that your customers are the ones who identify or vocalize the value, not you. Your hypothesis has to align with the value customers think that they are getting. if it doesn't you will introduce a lot of features that customers don't care about.

You can have more than one value that your product or service provides. For each different value you identify and prove, the more useful your product becomes.

## Growth Hypotheses
The growth hypothesis is an assumption on __how users will find your product or service__. Ask yourself, "what is your current growth hypothesis?" if you don't have one you are on the road to failure. You will not just bump into one that solves your unique growth problem. You need to actively be testing for things that will help grow the business. 

Every startup has some idea as to how they will grow. They have answered the question anyone someone asks, "How are you going to get users?" However, It is rare that their answer to this question has ever been tested. If there growth assumption is correct and it has been tested, then they would respond with, "We are getting users every day through multiple methods that are already working."

You probably already have a way your company is going to grow. Great! Now, rather than assume it will work, test and measure to prove it works. If it does work, keep the growth strategy active and come up with another way to grow even faster.

One of the reasons Dropbox was so successful is that they [constantly tested growth hypotheses](http://blog.kissmetrics.com/dropbox-hacked-growth/). When one of their assumptions (hypothesis) worked, they kept it and when one didn't they would abandon it. Are you doing things similar at your  startup?

## Always Changing and Improving
Hypothesis, should always change until they are proven. When one hypothesis is proven, come up with a "new" hypnosis and validate that too. The more value your product has, the more users want to use it. The more proven growth strategies your product has, the faster you will grow.

If you believe that something you have already proven can be improved, come up with a hypothesis to test it and try to increase it's effectiveness. Always challenge your assumptions. Doing so will give you better answers to the questions you will be constantly be asked.
