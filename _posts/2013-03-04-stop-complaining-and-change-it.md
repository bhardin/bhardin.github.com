Everyone has something to complain about. Some aspect of your life is bad. The world makes it easy to complain. But, if your problem disappeared, would it change anything? 

In your mind you have already setup a false expectation. You believe if your problem went away everything would be different. 

You're wrong. 

If tomorrow your problem no longer existed there would be a new problem. The world has an infinite supply of problems and problems have an exponential growth rate. 

## Comfort Brings Inactivity 

Complaining seems to be a natural tendency for those who are free from hardship. Once the bare necessities - food, water, and shelter - and a little disposable income are addressed we start to complain. 

If you complain about a problem, but are unmotivated to change the situation, it doesn't affect you bad enough. 

If you don't like something, don't talk about it, unless you have a different approach. Suggesting an alternative grants you permission to complain. But not forever. You are only allowed to complain only to explain the problem. To inform others of the pain. Then you need to offer a planned solution and begin executing the solution. If you suggest an alternative plan, but don't help with the implementation of the plan, you are not allowed to complain. 

## Criticizing 

It is easy to criticize. All you need is a mouth and an opinion. Everyone has those. When you attempt to recruit others to the _new_ way of thinking, other people will criticize you for your endeavor. Criticism is another form of complaint. It is easier for people to criticize the idea, rather than helping with change. 

Don't let them discourage you in your journey. 

When people are comfortable with the status quo they criticize anyone attempting to change it. No one wants to be uncomfortable. It's easy to live with the comfortable system. It's hard to change the comfortable system. It's even harder to affect others to change the comfortable, but problematic, system. 

## Projecting on Others 

When we identify someone who has solved our personal problem, we think they don't have problems. Everyone has problems. We envy those who don't have our problems. But, No one has the world figured out. 

People who don't have your personal problem have problems of their own. Everyone has problems. Having problems is part of the human condition. 

The world makes it easy to criticize, condemn, and complain. In contrast, changing something you criticize is incredibly hard. The easy way out is complaint. 

What bothers you and how are you attempting to change it?
