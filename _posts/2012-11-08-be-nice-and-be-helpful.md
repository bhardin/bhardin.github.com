Be nice and be helfpul. There are many famous quotes around this same sentiment.

* One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself.
* [Be the Change you want to see in the world.][1]
* Never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself.

I help people for only a single reason: to be helpful. Successful people require others to be successful. They require others opinions, networks, or resources in order to succeed. No one does it alone.

I enjoy [helping others who look to help themselves][2]. If someone asks for help I do my best to help them. When I talk to others, I make myself available. 

I prefer helping people with specific needs rather than general needs. People who are looking to help themselves already have an idea as to how I can help them. A great example is an introduction to someone stating why the introduction can help them. When I read the reason why they want an introduction, I don't just make it. Based on what the persons need is, I may know someone better suited to fit them.

Zig Zigler said this about helping others.

> You will get all you want in life if you help enough other people get what they want.

I loved this quote when I first heard it. I suggested the quote to others. But I then realized an anomaly in the quote. The quote is quid pro quo. It's saying, the only reason to help others is for personal benefit. I don't help others to benefit myself. If I get something out of helping others in return, that's great. But, it's not my motive.

I'm motivated to help others to make them happy. Do the same.

Help others in order to make them happy. Make people smile. When seeing someone hurting or in pain, see how you can help. If we all help each other, without trying to get something out of it, we can achieve great things. The world, and humanity, is very selfish. Be contrary to what the rest of the world does. Go against the grain. Be nice and be helpful.
