As a developer of closed and open source software I love the idea of using open source software to build faster. I also want to give credit to the developers of the software I use. 

I love benefiting from what others have contributed to the greater community. When I develop or contribute to an open source project, I want others to benefit from my work. I am pleased when others use my code.

If you use open source, why would you not want to give respect to the developers, that you directly benefit from?

This is the idea behind attribution; and it's required by the many open source licenses.

## Why do I have to attribute?

Many open source licenses have an attribution clause. Simply stated, if you use the open source you need to let others know that you are using it. This gives the creator of the open source credit for developing and releasing the code for others to use.

If you feel that attribution is a pain, then you are selfish or lazy. 

What is more complicated:

* Adding a page to your site or application stating you use a certain piece of software?
* Developing the software yourself?

## The GPL and AGPL Argument

AGPL, the Affero General Public License, was created to close a perceived loophole in the GPL license. GPL stated, If you distribute software that uses GPL software, you need to distribute your software under the GPL license.

Do to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) products, they don't "distribute software," therefore, SaaS companies don't need to respect GPL. So AGPL was created to address this issue.

Personally, this loophole doesn't respect the original "feel" of this license. The point of GPL, is if you benefit from the software, than others should benefit from what you create.

If you don't like the GPL/AGPL license. Don't use software that is licenses under it.

## Build Faster with Open Source

The entire time I have developed, I have been an advocate of open source. It is a great way to build things faster and easier. I have always hated reinventing the wheel and open source aids in not doing this However, as open source has proliferated the market, people have veered away from doing attribution correctly.

Most open source licenses state you only have to attribute with distributed software. SO for all the SaaS products created, developers don't need to attribute. I think this does not respect the licenses intention.

## Attribution The Right Way

Attribution is something you should do every time you use open source and it can be bothersome. It takes you away from working on what you love: developing code and solving problems. 

A simple attribution solution should exist that:

1. Isn't time consuming.
2. Changes as you add or remove open source to your application.

If anyone knows of anything that would do this, let me know.
