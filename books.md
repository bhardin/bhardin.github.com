I have suggested many people read this book and continue to. It is one of the first books I read on marketing and I still think it is the best. The book boils down the fundamental concepts of marketing into 3-5 pages. It is a good primer and from here you can go deep into each category.

### [The Paradox of Choice](http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&bc1=000000&IS2=1&bg1=FFFFFF&fc1=000000&lc1=0000FF&t=breharsblo-20&o=1&p=8&l=as4&m=amazon&f=ifr&ref=ss_til&asins=0060005696)

Paradox of Choice explains when people are faced with too many choices, they feel overwhelmed and will typically not choose something because of it. If you are in sales, marketing, developer, or a designer this book can greatly help in understanding how to minimize everything you say and do. Too many choices are bad. A simple choice (A or B) is great!

### [Venture Deals](http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&bc1=000000&IS2=1&bg1=FFFFFF&fc1=000000&lc1=0000FF&t=breharsblo-20&o=1&p=8&l=as4&m=amazon&f=ifr&ref=ss_til&asins=0470929820)

Before you fund raise, this should be required reading. Venture Deals clearly outlines how to approach fund raising, and how venture capitalists think about investments. I am amazed at how many companies are going into financing without ever have read this. I also have a favorite quote in the book that I typically ask people, to see whether they have read it.
